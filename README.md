# pyIn
a function that handles integers and floats inputs with no needing to cast it 

i got bored of casting every variable i get as an input so i created a module called pyIn 
you only need to specify what type you want to get from the user
"%s" for strings
"%i" for integers
"%f" for floats
i came from c & c++ background and i got inspired for that.
